#Overall, this project showcases my SQL querying skills and ability to extract meaningful insights from a real-world database.
##I have used different SQL functions like JOIN, COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to get the required results.

#1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Agent%';

#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices;

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, i.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.customerid=c.customerid;

#7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.total, c.lastname, c.firstname, c.country, e.lastname, e.firstname
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.customerid=c.customerid;

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9.What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid=t.trackid;

#11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.invoicelineid, a.name arist_name, t.name track_name
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid=t.trackid
JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.albumid=t.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists a
ON a.artistid=al.artistid;

#12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name track_name, a.title album_title, m.name media_type, g.name genre
FROM chinook.media_types m
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON m.mediatypeid=t.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumid=a.albumid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid=g.genreid;

#13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) Total_Sales, e.lastname, e.firstname
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid=i.invoiceid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) Total_Sales, e.lastname, e.firstname
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid=c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid=i.invoiceid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY total_sales desc
LIMIT 1;
